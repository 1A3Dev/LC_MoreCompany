# MoreCompany
Hello,
this mod is not affiliated with BiggerLobby.

Please do not take my source code and put it in another mod. I really don't want to have to have such a locked down repo as I usually never do this. But this is one of the only repositories I own where I feel its a requirement. Sorry!

# What you can and cannot do with this repository
- You do not have permission to port my mod to BepinEx as a major purpose of this mod is to get people switching to MelonLoader.
- You have permission to create forks of this repository and modify those forks. But you are not allowed to redistribute those forks in a public environment (200+ possible viewers) for reasons other than testing purposes. (eg. Uploading a fork to thunderstore is not allowed)
- Pull Requests are welcome! Feel free to improve on anything that you'd like and make a pull request, I review all of them.
